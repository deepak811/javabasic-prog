public abstract class Absexm3 {
	
	public abstract void m6();

}
//here code will compile successfully as the abstract class is having abstract method
//this sis an ebstract metod having declration only and no implementation


//if a class has only 1 abstract method  then it needs to be declared as abstract class & a  class that contain 0 no. of abstract method that can also be declared as abstract class 
//example: httpservlet is an abstract class but it doesn’t contains any abstractmethod.
//Or adaptar class
